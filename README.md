an experiment in simple connected to-do lists.

This project is the server counterpart to the [tudo app](https://github.com/cachapa/tudo).

## Usage

The simplest way to run the program is to run main.dart:

``` shell
$ pub get
$ dart bin/main.dart --port 8080
Serving at http://localhost:8080
```

However, you might prefer to precompile the program into native code, making it much more efficient:

``` shell
$ pub get
$ dart compile exe bin/main.dart -o tudo_server
$ ./tudo_server --port 8080
Serving at http://localhost:8080
```

## Hosting

While this project can be hosted from any internet-accessible device, keep in mind:

* It isn't suited for serverless hosting (e.g. Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Run) since the server uses websockets for long-running sessions
* HTTPS is required as modern Android and iOS versions disallow apps from establishing plaintext connections

> ⚠️ **Note**: Make sure to set a unique `secret` in `lib/config.dart` if your instance is accessible from the internet.
